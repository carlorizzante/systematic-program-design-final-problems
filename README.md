# Systematic Program Design - Final Problems
A collection of final projects while studying Systematic Program Design, the most interesting bits anyway.

The programs are currently written in BSL using Dr.Racket, since those are the language and the tool used to teach Systematic Program Design at the University of British Columbia, along with the corresponding UBCx course.

The entire SPD path has been recently restructured into a new set of 6 parts.

## 01. Lander
Assignment involving Compound data.

Lander is a very basic interactive video game where the player has to land a block on the bottom side of a canvas against gravity.

## 02. Bubbles
Assignment involving Reference and Self Reference.

Bubbles of various sizes and colors pop up and fade away at the pressure of the "space bar".

## 03. Naturals
An interesting experiment redefining a custom set of Natural numbers (more precisely an equivalent representation) and relative methods to work with it.

## 04. Helpers
A small set of methods to support a sorting function operating on a list of images of various sizes.
